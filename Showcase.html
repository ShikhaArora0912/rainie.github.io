            This year throughout my academic journey, I had the privilege of being part of chess club and media club. I further sharpened my critical thinking and teamwork abilities. Overall, my education has provided me with a solid academic background and a passion for continuous learning.

            <h4>Experience</h4><br>
            
                I joined a lot of cocurriculars and competitions at school and I play a musical instrument, done a few volunteer work and played some sports out of school. I'm currently learning violin in school and I'm self-learning piano at the moment. I achieved ABRSM grade 8 piano and migrated to New Zealand two years ago. After that, I started playing songs that I like rather than continuing taking piano exams.
I also sold flags, joined the Volunteer Space (spending a few weeks with a group of teenagers preparing, learning, helping out and at last visiting elderly people in Hong Kong) and Letter to Stranger (hand writing and delivering an empathetic and heart-warming letter to a stranger). 
I also have weekly basketball and table tennis training during the weekends. I enjoy playing sports with my friends and my family.
Joining these activities have made my out of school life more fulfilling. In the future, I plan to participate in more volunteer work.
